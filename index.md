## About Me

Hi there! I am a Ph.D. student of Computer Science at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://science.rpi.edu/computer-science), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yao Ma](https://yaoma24.github.io), previously advised by [Ziniu Hu](https://acbull.github.io).

Prior to that, I obtained my master's degree in computer science from [Courant Institute of Mathematics at New York University](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/). I received my CS, Mathematics and Piano Performace Bachelor degree from [Oberlin College and Conservatory](https://www.oberlin.edu), fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Sam Taggart](http://samueltaggart.com) (CS) and Prof. [Peter Tak√°cs](https://www.oberlin.edu/peter-takacs) (Piano).
